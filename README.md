# product-sentiment-analysis

Perform sentiment analysis on the dataset using the ML-based approach. 

Load, clean, and preprocess the data as you find necessary. 

Using the training data, extract features from the text (i.e., BOW and/or Bag of N-Grams and/or topics and/or lexical features and/or whatever you want).  

Use your favorite ML algorithm to train a classification model.  Don’t forget everything that we’ve learned in our ML course: hyperparameter tuning, cross validation, handling imbalanced data, etc. Make reasonable decisions and try to create the best-performing classifier that you can. 

Use the testing data to measure the accuracy and F1-score of your model.
